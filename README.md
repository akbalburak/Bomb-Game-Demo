## Some Usefull Tips About Project
#### Save and Load System
You can use SaveData.cs to save any data into mobile device storage.
An important note : After any changes made, make sure you have called the SaveChanges() method in the SaveData.cs.
SaveLoadController.cs is going to load data from playerprefs automaticly.

#### Creating A Level
- Right click anywhere in the Levels folder and navigate the Create - Levels -> New Level.
- While you build a level, you should care the following things.
  - Level column and row counts limited with 9.
  - 0 represent -> Its an empty place.
  - 1 represent -> Its a brick place.
  - The Bomb Count player may use is calculated automatically via the brick count + 2 when the level initialized.
- As last step, just drag the new level into the LevelDataService's "Levels" property which is located in Services object in the scene.

#### Managing Menus
- You may use MenuViewController.cs to manage views, normally in the scene there is no ui element. They are instantiated from the Prefabs folder after dragged into the MenuViewController class.
- Before showing any menu to optmize memory management make sure you call the CloseAll() method in the MenuViewController.cs

## Final Thoughts
It was a funny project. Most probably i am going to update these repository in a couple of week for new sprites, sounds and other things.

For now, See you later.üëè
